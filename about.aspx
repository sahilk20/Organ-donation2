                                       Organ donation is giving an organ to help someone who needs a transplant. Kidneys, heart, liver, lungs, pancreas and the small bowel can all be transplanted.

Transplants are one of the biggest achievements of modern medicine and can save or greatly enhance the lives of other people. However, they depend completely on donors and their families consenting to organ or tissue donation. One donor can save the life of several people, restore the sight of two others and improve the quality of life of many more.
 
In England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, organs and tissue from a potential donor will only be used if that is their wish. Consent is needed first. Giving consent can be done by joining the National Health Service (NHS) Organ Donor Register (see 'Resources'), or by people discussing their wishes with their loved ones. If their wishes are not clear, the person closest to them in life will be asked what they think they would have wanted. This is why it is important that people make sure they are aware of their loved one’s views on organ donation (see ‘Consenting to organ donation’). Wales, has has an ‘opt-out’ system where, unless a person opts-out of organ donation, it is assumed that he or she has no objection to becoming an organ donor (1st December 2015). (This is currently also being debated in the Scottish Parliament).
 
Joining the Organ Donor Register is a way of giving legal consent for donation to take place. Everyone can join the NHS Organ Donation Register regardless of age or health, as long as they are considered legally competent. It is the person’s physical condition rather than their age, that is the deciding factor. Having a medical condition does not necessarily prevent a person from becoming an organ or tissue donor. The decision about whether some or all organs or tissue are suitable for transplant is made by a doctor, taking into account a person’s medical history. Anyone who has been diagnosed with HIV or has, or is suspected of having, CJD, cannot become an organ or tissue donor.
